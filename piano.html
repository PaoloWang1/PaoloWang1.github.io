							<p>Here are a few of my recorded piano performances that I made for Certificate of Merit in 2021 and 2022. I've played countless other pieces, but only these were recorded as in person performances were taken out after the start fo the pandemic.</p>

							<p>This is my favorite piece. Chopin is truly the GOAT 🐐🐐🐐🐐. I could've done way better on the trills at the beginning of the piece, but I was in a rush to finish learning my other CM pieces the week I recorded this so I didn't try to record a better version.</p>

							<p>Another Chopin piece, another banger. Not much else to say.</p>

								Another one of my favorites. However, it's probably the most cliche piece you can play.

							<p>I didn't like this song and only played it to satisfy CM requirements. It might sound interesting the first time you hear it, but practicing this piece over and over again was not fun.</p>
